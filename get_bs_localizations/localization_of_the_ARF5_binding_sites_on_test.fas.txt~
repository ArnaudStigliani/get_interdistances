Here the binding sites are present after a white space. For example, with the sequence 
"AGTAGTCAT TGT CAGATAGAAAGAAAGAG CAGACAAAAGGATCG"
Because a binding site has a length of 6 bp, this means there is a first binding site: 
TGTCAGA, a second one: CAGATA and a last one: CAGACA.
The matrix used is: ../matrix/ARF5_OMalley_Cmatrix.txt
